This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Questions:
1. If this was a real SaaS tool, what 2 features would you prioritize next and why?
Ans: This was just the UI of the platform. Our next focus should be the backend.
    We could start with the functionality of create new avatar button, a form with the following fields- Name, a few personality fields(optional), profession(optional), image, etc. We could also integrate AI which would generate editable avatar based on personality, etc which would help mordenise our platform.
    The next important functionality would be login and authentication. Users may choose to allow others to edit from their respective accounts or keep them on view mode only. Authentication and security as some other person shouldn't be able to access or change your data/ avatars. It will also enable features like subscriptions or usage limits.

2. What was one challenge you faced in this task, and how did you solve or approach it?
Ans: One challenge I faced was in this task was trying to make the UI look more visually appealing by adding effects such as gradients using Tailwind and using Framer Motion for smooth modern animations and also maintaining a consistent yet appropriate theme. I wasnt familiar with Framer motion before . So i watched some tutorials and read the docs to implement the smooth animations using framer motion. i overcame the challenge of selecting appripriate theme by focusing on what it should reflect, i.e, tech, futurism, AI, etc.Though the option of toggling light and dark theme would be better keeping in mind diverse users.
